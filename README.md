# !Minhstagram

Welcome to !Minhstagram, an attempt to re-create a very popular image site. (work in progress)

This app is deployed at:  https://salty-oasis-25364.herokuapp.com 

It is hosted on the free plan so give it a bit to wake up when loading it.

The functionalities are: (currently, more to come)

•	Create an account

•	Login

•	Create post

•	“explore” all the posts

•	Infinite scrolling

•	Delete your posts under “my posts”


We did share this with a ton of people and asked them to be family-friendly with the content that they post but I apologize if there's anything on there that you might find offensive.


If you want to try it out for yourself.

1) clone down

2) cd into backend
run these commands
```
npm install
node server.js
```

3) leave the backend up and cd into frontend
```
npm install
npm start
```
4) go to your localhost/3000 and enjoy!!
